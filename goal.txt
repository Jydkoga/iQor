basically group the accounts into segments/ clusters 
and then show that these segments show shared behaviour based on the data 


Finding patterns in dataset using manipulation/classification. 
Reason: not immediately obvious goal (open-ended things to do with dataset.)
making predictions and evaluating accuracy to see important/unimportant features.
^ directly gives us role of different features in dataset and classes.

Now we want to focus on how those features describe individual groups and classes.
also want to see magnitude of value (all from same place? Variance of income?)


1. PCA --> preserve most important/relevant features
--> see which are the most variant dimensions. And limit without compressing. 
dont directly pipeline PCA --> k-means. Instead just find the most interesting features and then only consider them in the k-means.

2. k-means clustering?
Centroids have dimension --> determine levels of relevant features

How to know accuracy?
metric --> measure cluster density (avg dist from centroid?)

Ask iQor: what do you want to classify? One feature.
Do feature importance for that classification question.

- try different classification questions?
see what features are consistent throughout different classification questions

confusion matrix?
